# Godot 4 Mobile Development Rules

## Language & Version
- Use **GDScript** for all game logic unless C# is specifically requested.
- Target **Godot 4.x** syntax. (e.g., use `@onready` instead of `onready`, `Input.is_action_just_pressed` instead of older versions).
- Use **PascalCase** for class names and **snake_case** for variables and functions.

## Mobile Optimization
- Always suggest **TouchScreenButton** or `_input(event)` handling for `InputEventScreenTouch` rather than just keyboard inputs.
- Prefer **VBoxContainer** and **HBoxContainer** for UI to ensure responsiveness across different screen aspect ratios.
- Keep draw calls low; suggest using **ParticlesProcessMaterial** for effects.

## Project Structure
- Suggest a modular scene-based structure. 
- Keep scripts attached to their relevant nodes.
- Use `class_name` to make scripts globally accessible to the AI's "awareness."

## AI Workflow
- When writing a new script, always include a brief comment at the top explaining the node type it should be attached to.
- If a bug involves physics, suggest checking the **Collision Layers** and **Masks**.
